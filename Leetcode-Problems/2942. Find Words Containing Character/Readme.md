# 2942. Find Words Containing Character

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a character `x`.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character `x`.

The returned array may be in **any order**.

## Example 1

```text
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet" and "code", so we return indices 0 and 1.
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc" and "aaaa", so we return indices 0 and 2.
```

## Example 3

```text
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any word, so we return an empty array.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 50`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `x` is a lowercase English letter.
- `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
